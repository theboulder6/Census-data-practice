# Census data project 
# This repository will deal with python and pandas practice using a census dataset as practice
# I aim to cover data cleaning protocols and analysis while employing subsetting, grouping, pivot tables and plotting among other skills
# The data is available from https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities as a free download 
# I may come back and work more on this in teh future but now I think its a good quick demo
